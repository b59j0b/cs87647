Cover Page and Abstract
Intro (aprox 1.5 pgs)Heading is Title of Your Paper1.   General background   - broad overview of research on this topic (Body image concerns) (KEEP IT RESEARCH FOCUSED)   THEORY   – gender differences in body image concerns. A majority of the research (historically) focused on body fat, the outcomes, what this lead to. More current research (McCreary, Saucier,  Courtenay, 2005) is challenging this.2.   Previous Research   – specific examples – 2 sources used in the article (be careful of correctly citing), McCreary et al. (2005) article in detail - theory, what they were looking for and what they found (RESULTS: 4 important findings 1) men score higher on DMS regardless of GBV. 2) 3 Masculine Measures are related to DMS 3) Feminine traits are not related to lower DMS 4) No Differential Salience *Final discussion （showing   you   know   the   article   and   understanding it）3.   Introduce Current Study   - Why we’re doing it etc. to address limitations of McCreary et al. (2005), different population and measures. Differences between current study and McCreary et al. (2005) – for body image measure – BSQ – Drive for Muscularity Scale (DMS) and BSQS ***current study is using measures geared toward body fat and muscularity together. For gender - personality measure BSRI (different measure, exploring different aspect of gender role socialization).    ·   Research Questions (not bullets, paragraph):·   Is there a difference between men and women in body image between concern with muscle mass and concern with body fat/body shape? If so what is it? Hyp – men are going to score higher on DMS women higher on BSQS (based upon McCrery’s theory and findings).·   What are the relationships between masculinity/femininity and drive for muscularity/body shape concerns?    Is masculinity correlated with drive for muscularity? Hyp –Yes positive correlation between masculinity and DFM (theory and prior research). For DFM and FEM McCreary theorized a relationship but didn’t f代 写Psychology experiment report Lab #1

Method section: (aprox 2 pgs)
Participants:   A total of xxx participants completed surveys. There were xxx (%) men and xxx (%) women between the ages of xx and xx with the average age of xx years old. (Add other demographic information; percent of population below xx years old, report ALL sexual orientation, ALL class and ethnicity).
Procedure:
How you did it, with detail (Use guide for writing a lab report)…
Measures:
Sentences Explaining Our Measures: 1 survey – 2 measures BSQ consists of DMS and BSQS and Rate Your Traits = BSRI consists of MAS FEM and AND scales 
Describe Scales:
Drive for Muscularity Scale (DMS).   Use your article as a guide to describe this scale (how many items, what its measuring, how its scored, WE DID NOT REVERSE CODE, sample questions, validity); and then our specific results for the alphas – overall alpha = XXX
Body Shape Questionnaire Scale (BSQS). Do same for BSQS as for DMS (describe it in the same way as article did for DMS; use BSQ article to help); overall alpha = XXX
Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI). Do same (Use BSRI article) – measure for masculinity; femininity; androgyny; alpha for MAS = XXX and for FEM = XXX. Androgynous scale wasn’t used for analysis.
